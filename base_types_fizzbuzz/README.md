### Base types FizzBuzz

Create a function which generates and returns a list with numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive
where the `n` is passed as a parameter to the function.
But if the number is divided by 3 the function puts a `Fizz` word 
into the list, and if the number is divided by 5 the function puts
a `Buzz` word into the list. If the number is divided both by 3 and 5 the function puts
`FizzBuzz` into the list.
