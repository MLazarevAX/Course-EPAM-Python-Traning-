## Base Types
### Fractions
Create a function what takes two parameters of string type which are 
fractions with the same denominator and returns a sum expression of these fractions and the sum result.
For example:
```python
>>> a_b = '1/3'
>>> c_b = '5/3'
>>> get_fractions(a_b, c_b)
'1/3 + 5/3 = 6/3'
```
